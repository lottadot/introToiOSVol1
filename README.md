# Intro to iOS

This repo contains the application which will be used in the @BuckeyeCocoa presentation `Intro to iOS` sponsored by the @ColumbusWebGroup.

## Theory

The theory behind this app is a group of non-programmers can make a *very* simple app in just a few hours with a bit of direction.

### The App

The app's premise is picking a cut bunny. Or not. The intent is to show how a ViewController works, along with basic UIKit controls, logical unit tests and UI Acceptance Tests.
